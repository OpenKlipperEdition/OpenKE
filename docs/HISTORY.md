# ke-mainline-klipper (historical name)

Standalone investigation/build workspace for this printer's underlying platform (Klipper fork,
kernel, OS), **completely separate from the OpenKE/GuppyScreen project**
(`~/Documents/guppyscreen`, `ke-next`/`main` branches). Nothing here should be folded into that
repo's branches or release planning.

## Three tracks (as of 2026-07-18)

1. **Mainline Klipper + load-cell probe** - see "Status" and "Current focus" below, plus
   `ANALYSIS.md`/`DESIGN.md`. Goal: "SimpleAF + the probe" (SimpleAF's own framing, see below).
   PAUSED, resume after `ke-next` testing. Memory: `project_mainline_klipper_ke_separate.md`.
2. **USB-ethernet adapter compatibility** - see `NETWORKING.md`. Motivated by poor WiFi
   reliability. Fully scoped, not started - the fix now lives inside track 3's Phase 1 (see below).
   Memory: `project_ke_platform_networking.md`.
3. **Build our own firmware package (kernel + OS)** - see `FIRMWARE.md`, the source-of-truth doc
   for this track, kept up to date as work continues (edit it in place rather than creating new
   dated files - `git log` on this file already gives the chronological trail if ever needed).
   The big underlying question both track 2 needed and the user asked directly: how hard would a
   real custom kernel/OS be, not just a driver or a Klipper module. **Phase 0 (research/source
   acquisition) is essentially complete** - real vendor documentation was found in the OpenKE
   workspace's `docs hw/` directory, an exact-matching kernel source was found on GitHub and cloned
   into `vendor/` (gitignored), the real partition table was parsed, and the chip's silicon-level
   recovery mode is fully documented. **Phase 1 build+vermagic-verify DONE, `insmod` test on real
   device is the next step. Phase 2's Buildroot rootfs BUILD also DONE 2026-07-19** (real
   `uImage`+`rootfs.ext2`, zero device writes) - see `FIRMWARE.md`'s "Phase 2 results" section.
   Memory: `project_ke_custom_firmware.md`.

All three tracks share the same workspace and a lot of platform-level groundwork (SoC identity,
kernel source, etc.) - that shared material lives in track 3's files/memory, not duplicated across
all three.

## Status: WiFi now fully working on the custom kernel, real hardware, end to end (2026-07-22)

**Track 3's custom Linux 6.6 kernel now boots on real hardware with fully working WiFi** - the
device connects, gets a real DHCP lease, and is reachable over the network, all independently
verified (`ping` from an external host). This was the single biggest open item blocking the whole
custom-kernel track; the sections below (some dated 2026-07-19/20) predate this and describe an
earlier, much less complete state - see `FIRMWARE.md` §44-53 for the real, full story (a genuine
multi-session hardware bring-up investigation: a detection race found and fixed, two separate GPIO
polarity bugs found via disassembling stock's own live kernel modules and fixed, and a kernel-image-
embedded-firmware fix for a driver-probe-vs-rootfs-mount timing race). `scripts/build/README.md` is
the current, accurate way to reproduce this build from scratch - WiFi firmware/CLM/NVRAM are all
fetched and hash-verified automatically (`scripts/firmware/fetch-cyw43430-wifi-firmware.sh` plus an
inline NVRAM fetch, both never committed to this repo), no manual device-extraction step needed.

The paragraphs immediately below (IN PROGRESS, 2026-07-19/20) are kept for their real historical
value but are superseded by the above and by `FIRMWARE.md`'s own much longer, more current record.

`ke-next`'s M600 fixes were confirmed working on real hardware and `v1.5.0-OpenKE` shipped
(2026-07-18/19) - the "paused until ke-next real-device testing is done" condition below is now
satisfied. Track 3 item 1 (ethernet driver `insmod` test) is exactly where it was left: the
`ax88179_178a` kernel module is built and vermagic-verified, but not yet transferred to or tested
on the real device. **Next session: go straight to Todo item 1's "Remaining" paragraph** - don't
redo the build, just re-check the printer is idle and run the `insmod` test.

**New this session (2026-07-19, done autonomously while the user was away for the afternoon,
explicitly pre-approved to make the fork-vs-standalone call and proceed without further
check-ins)**: Track 1 items 2-4 are done. Researched pellcorp's actual `klipper`/`kalico` forks
directly (both use the exact stock `klippy/extras/<module>.py` layout, no structural change
needed for either target - see `DESIGN.md`'s new top section), made the two small flagged calls
per their stated leaning, and **implemented all six `klippy_extras/` files with real, working
logic** (no more `NotImplementedError` skeletons) - MCU protocol, calibration math (with 17
passing standalone unit tests against synthetic data, no hardware needed -
`klippy_extras/test_prtouch_calibration.py`), touch-probe orchestration, nozzle-wipe, and the new
`z_compensate` per-print Z-offset piece. All six files pass `python3 -m py_compile`. Full account
of what changed vs. the original design sketch, and everything deliberately left out of v1, is in
`DESIGN.md`'s new "What actually changed during implementation" and "Deliberately dropped for v1"
sections - read those before touching this code.

**Deliberately not done, and should not be done without the user present**: no real hardware was
touched this session - no flashing, no installing SimpleAF, no changes to the live printer, which
is shared with `ke-next` testing and where a bad flash has no one present to help recover from.
The code above is untested against real firmware. **Real-hardware validation is the actual next
step for Track 1** - see the Todo below.

**Also this session, later on (2026-07-19, same "away for the afternoon, pre-approved to proceed"
arrangement, this time explicitly scoped to "minimal proof-of-pipeline" via the user's own answer
to that framing)**: Track 3 Phase 2's Buildroot rootfs build is done - a real, working Linux
6.1.28 kernel (`uImage`) + Buildroot 2023.11.1 rootfs (`rootfs.ext2`), cross-compiled cleanly with
zero errors using the real vendor-community `halley5_x2000_defconfig`, saved at
`artifacts/buildroot-halley5-image/`. QEMU boot-tested as a bonus verification step and got the
expected negative result (no console output - there's no X2000 machine model in QEMU, confirmed
via prior art before attempting, not a build defect); the build's own correctness was instead
confirmed via direct `debugfs` inspection of the rootfs image. Full write-up, including the real
remaining gaps before this could replace the device's actual software (package selection,
squashfs conversion, device-tree fit, and the real-hardware boot test itself), is in
`FIRMWARE.md`'s "Phase 2 results" section. **Also deliberately not done**: no real hardware
touched for this either - the build is 100% local Docker compute, and the eventual real-hardware
boot test is explicitly left for when the user is present.

**Later the same day (2026-07-19), user's explicit call: "build everything first" to minimize
real-hardware testing time later**, given how solid the recovery-path finding above turned out
(real physical BOOT/RESET buttons on the Nebula Pad's own PCB, documented Ingenic USB BOOT DEVICE
recovery mode - confirmed from Creality's own official "Brick Rescue and Wire Brushing" PDF, not
just inference). Result: touch, display, WiFi, Bluetooth, and camera are now all real, built, and
(for touch/display/WiFi/BT) actually wired into the `rootfs.ext2`/`uImage` image - not just plans:

- **Touch**: real device-tree wiring (`&i2c4` enabled + `ns2009@48` node) added directly to the
  compiled board DTS, alongside the already-ported NS2009 driver.
- **Display**: a genuinely new panel driver (`panel-openke-general-480x272.c`) written from scratch
  for the ingenicfb "fb_stage" framework, using the real, live-confirmed GPIO pins (PC21 power,
  PB16 reset) and a best-effort standard 480x272 timing (no datasheet found for the exact part -
  wrong values would show a bad picture, not damage hardware). Two real compile-time API mismatches
  found and fixed (wrong ops-struct type; a GPIO-flags API removed from this kernel version).
- **WiFi/Bluetooth**: real `mmc-pwrseq-simple` DT wiring to the confirmed WL_REG_ON GPIO,
  `brcmfmac`/`BT_HCIUART_3WIRE` enabled. Found and fixed two real Kconfig gate/naming bugs. One
  real, honestly-unresolved tension left open: mainline's automatic Broadcom firmware-loading only
  works with H4, but this device's own module naming implies H5 - left as H5-only for now.
- **A real, structural Buildroot bug found and fixed**: direct kernel-config edits inside the build
  directory were silently discarded on the next full rebuild, because Buildroot's package tracking
  watches the source-override directory, not the build directory - `rootfs.ext2` kept missing new
  modules despite "successful" builds. Fixed with a real, persistent Buildroot config fragment file
  (`board/halley5-nebulaos-fragment.config`) + `make linux-reconfigure`. **New standing rule for this
  workspace: kernel config changes must go through that fragment file, never direct in-place
  `.config` edits** - the latter are invisible to Buildroot's own tracking and get silently
  discarded on the next full rebuild.
- **Camera**: cross-compiled `pellcorp/k1-ustreamer` (a real µStreamer port; GPLv3-licensed - the
  vendored `LICENSE` file is the full GPLv3 text, corrected 2026-07-26 after this entry originally,
  incorrectly, called it MIT) cleanly to a
  confirmed real MIPS32r2 binary - saved as an artifact, not yet integrated into the rootfs image
  itself (needs its shared libs added as a Buildroot package or rootfs overlay - real, smallish
  remaining work).

Full subsystem-by-subsystem write-up, including both real compile errors and all three Kconfig
bugs, is in `FIRMWARE.md` §10. **Deliberately not done, same as always**: no real hardware touched -
this was 100% local Docker cross-compilation plus documentation reading (the recovery-path PDF).

### Readiness comparison: all three "done, needs testing" items - NOT the same level of done, read before assuming any of them is close

Asked and answered explicitly 2026-07-19 - recorded here so it never needs re-deriving:

- **Track 3 item 1 (ethernet driver)**: build + **vermagic verification** done - the four `.ko`
  files report the exact same `vermagic` string as the real device's own existing modules. That's
  strong, concrete evidence the build is correct; the *only* remaining step is physically running
  `insmod` on the real device and checking `dmesg`/`ip link`. Genuinely "just needs testing" -
  low-risk, session-only, one clear pass/fail check.
- **Track 1 (`klippy_extras/` prtouch_v2 + z_compensate)**: all six files have real, complete
  logic, and the pure-math half (`prtouch_calibration.py`) has 17 passing unit tests against
  synthetic data - that part is genuinely verified. But the MCU protocol layer, probe
  orchestration, and nozzle-wipe code have **never executed against anything real at all** - not
  just "untested on hardware." There is no mocked/simulated Klipper printer object standing in
  for a real one anywhere in this codebase or in Klipper itself, so this code has never even been
  smoke-tested inside an actual `klippy` process, real MCU or otherwise. Calling this "just needs
  testing" like the driver would overstate its readiness - it's closer to "first real exercise of
  carefully-read-but-never-run code." There's also a smaller unresolved item: only the *file
  layout* was confirmed to match SimpleAF's conventions (`klippy/extras/<module>.py`, both
  `pellcorp/klipper` and `pellcorp/kalico`) - whether anything else about SimpleAF's specific fork
  needs adjustment (config parsing quirks, module-load order, etc.) is unverified, not just
  untested.
- **Track 3 Phase 2 (Buildroot rootfs image)**: the cross-compile itself is about as verified as
  it can be without real hardware - it succeeded with zero errors, and the result was independently
  sanity-checked via `debugfs` (correct directory layout, correct `os-release`, `busybox` present
  and correctly sized), not just "the build command exited 0." But unlike the ethernet driver,
  there is genuinely **no boot-level verification at all** - QEMU couldn't provide one (no X2000
  machine model exists, confirmed before trying, not a gap in effort) and there's no device-side
  equivalent of a vermagic string to check ahead of time, since this isn't a module being loaded
  into a currently-running kernel - it's an entirely separate kernel (6.1.28 vs. the device's
  running 4.4.94). So this sits between the other two: better-verified than the load-cell module
  (a real artifact exists and was inspected, not just read-and-reasoned-about), but with a real,
  unavoidable gap the ethernet driver doesn't have - nothing confirms it actually boots on real
  silicon, and nothing short of a real boot test can.

**Practical takeaway**: if picking what to test first once you're back, the ethernet driver is the
safest, fastest win - verifying a build already strongly likely to work. The load-cell module
needs more careful, attended testing (raw MCU step pulses during `touch_probe()`, no `trsync`
safety net if something goes wrong mid-probe - ANALYSIS.md §6). The Buildroot image is furthest
from real validation and represents the biggest unknown of the three if a real boot is ever
attempted - and per Phase 3 above, that's real hardware work that also needs you present, plus
real package-selection/squashfs work first before it's even worth attempting.

## Todo (as of 2026-07-19)

1. **[Track 3, MOVED 2026-07-19] Phase 1 - build + test the ethernet driver.**
   **Build + vermagic verification DONE (2026-07-19)**: `ax88179_178a.ko`, `usbnet.ko`, `mii.ko`,
   `asix.ko` all cross-compiled against `vendor/x2000_kernel` with `CONFIG_USB_NET_AX88179_178A`
   enabled, and all four confirmed to report the exact same
   `vermagic=4.4.94 SMP preempt mod_unload MIPS32_R2 32BIT` string as the real device's own existing
   modules. **This targets the real device's *current, stock* 4.4.94 kernel, not this workspace's
   custom 6.6.18-rt23 rebuild** - the two are ABI-incompatible regardless (different kernel version,
   different module ABI entirely) - so the actual deliverable (wired ethernet on the printer as it
   runs today) is properly homed in the main OpenKE project instead: the build recipe now lives at
   `~/Documents/guppyscreen/scripts/build-ax88179-mipsel.sh` and the built `.ko` files at
   `~/Documents/guppyscreen/scripts/vendor/modules/` - moved there since that's the actively-shipped
   project this fix is actually deployable against, not duplicated in both repos. **Remaining, not
   yet done, from that new location**: `scp` the four `.ko` files to the real printer, confirm it's
   idle with a *fresh* `print_stats` check, then `insmod` them (dependency order: `mii` → `usbnet` →
   `asix` → `ax88179_178a`) and check `dmesg`/`ip link` for a new interface. This is also track 2's
   entire remaining fix - one piece of work closes both. Separately, the custom 6.6 rootfs *does*
   now have its own `ax88179_178a` support too (item 6 below) - built fresh against that kernel,
   not reusing this 4.4.94 build, since they're not interchangeable.
2. **[Track 1, DONE 2026-07-19]** ~~Resolve one open design question before writing real
   `klippy_extras/` logic~~ - resolved: target SimpleAF's own environment. Both of pellcorp's
   forks (`klipper`, `kalico`) use the exact stock `klippy/extras/<module>.py` layout, so no
   structural change was needed either way - see `DESIGN.md`'s top section.
3. **[Track 1, DONE 2026-07-19]** ~~Resolve the two smaller open questions in `DESIGN.md`~~ -
   both resolved per their stated leaning: `Z_OFFSET_AUTO` not registered, plain `command_error`
   used instead of Creality's `PR_ERR_CODE_*` catalog.
4. **[Track 1, DONE 2026-07-19, NOT hardware-tested]** ~~implement `klippy_extras/`~~ - all six
   files now have real logic (protocol, calibration math, touch-probe, nozzle-wipe, z_compensate).
   Calibration math has 17 passing standalone unit tests against synthetic data. See `DESIGN.md`'s
   "What actually changed during implementation" section for the specifics.
5. **[Track 1, NEW real next step] Real-hardware validation** - nothing in `klippy_extras/` has
   run against actual MCU firmware yet. Needs, in order: (a) get this code plus the real
   `printer.cfg` `[prtouch_v2]`/`[z_compensate]` sections onto a test Klipper checkout (SimpleAF's
   own environment, per the resolved design question above), (b) a `FIRMWARE_RESTART`/config
   round-trip to confirm the module loads and the MCU accepts the config commands without
   protocol errors, (c) a real `NOZZLE_CLEAR`/`Z_OFFSET_CALIBRATION` run watched closely with the
   printer attended the whole time (raw MCU step pulses, no `trsync` safety net - ANALYSIS.md §6).
   **Do not attempt this without the user present** - this is real hardware, not a reversible
   config change.
6. **[Track 3, REBASED 2026-07-19, NOT hardware-tested]** ~~a custom Buildroot rootfs using the
   now-validated kernel/toolchain~~ - first built against `Ingenic-community/linux` (6.1.28), then
   **rebased onto `Llixuma/ingenic-linux-kernel6.6-x2000-v1.0-20250221`** (a more complete, newer
   vendor SDK with native X2000 display+camera support, found and verified same session - see
   `FIRMWARE.md` §7's "Update" subsection) **by explicit user instruction**. Real, working `uImage`
   (Linux **6.6.18-rt23** - a real-time kernel, unplanned bonus) + `rootfs.ext2` built cleanly using
   the real vendor defconfig `x2000_halley5_v30_linux` (display + camera both enabled by default in
   this one defconfig switch), saved at `artifacts/buildroot-halley5-v30-image/` (the earlier
   6.1-based `artifacts/buildroot-halley5-image/` is superseded but left in place). Three real,
   distinct build errors hit and fixed along the way (a known upstream Linux `binder.h` quirk, a
   stale kernel-headers version label, a repeat of Phase 1's "fresh container has no packages"
   gotcha) - full detail in `FIRMWARE.md` §8. **The NS2009 touch driver was also re-ported and
   rebuilt against this new kernel** (two more real, kernel-version-specific fixes found: the
   `i2c_driver.probe` callback signature change, and `CONFIG_INPUT_TOUCHSCREEN`'s own menu gate not
   being enabled by default) - saved at `artifacts/ns2009-driver/`, vermagic-consistent with the
   new kernel. **WiFi/BT config, a real panel device-tree entry + driver, and touch's own DT
   wiring were all completed in the 2026-07-19 "build everything first" pass** (see the Status
   section above and `FIRMWARE.md` §10) - all now built and present in `rootfs.ext2`/`uImage`.
   **Display timing was later corrected via real disassembly of the live device's own driver, and a
   new Broadcom H5 Bluetooth vendor extension was written from scratch (`FIRMWARE.md` §11) -
   resolving the BT H4-vs-H5 tension architecturally, though still untested on real hardware.**
   **Camera (`ustreamer` + libs) and the Core SoC infra RNG gap were also closed (`FIRMWARE.md`
   §12)**, and **USB-Ethernet (`ax88179_178a`) support was added fresh for this kernel too
   (`FIRMWARE.md` §16 - a separate build from Phase 1's 4.4.94 one, hit the same "menu gate not
   enabled by default" Kconfig class of bug as touch's own fix above)** - every peripheral now has
   real code built and present in the image. **Squashfs now built too (`FIRMWARE.md` §17)** -
   `rootfs.squashfs` (43.56 MB) as an additional image output alongside the proven `rootfs.ext2`,
   matching the real device's filesystem format (the full production A/B+overlay scheme itself is
   still real, separate future work). **GuppyScreen also cross-compiled and wired in for real
   local visual feedback during the first boot test** (`FIRMWARE.md` §17) - not the full
   environment-adaptation project (item 7 below), just a real, working binary + config given the
   risk that losing WiFi on first boot with no local UI means no way back into the device at all.
   Remaining: the app stack (see item 8 below), WiFi credentials for the first boot (decided - kept
   out of any committed image, see `FIRMWARE.md` §17), and the actual real-hardware boot test.
   **Still uses the spare `rootfs2`/`kernel2` partition slots as the eventual target once a real
   flash is ever attempted** (confirmed unused, `FIRMWARE.md` §4b) - nothing about that plan
   changed. **Access-path audit done 2026-07-19 (`FIRMWARE.md` §18)**: checked SSH/password/console
   readiness against the real device rather than assuming. Found and fixed three real gaps - no SSH
   server was enabled (added dropbear), root's password was completely empty (set to a fresh,
   documented `openke` via Buildroot's own mechanism - deliberately not a copy of the real device's
   unverified password), and the console getty was on the wrong tty (`ttyS3` configured vs. the real
   device's own `ttyS4`, confirmed via a fresh `/proc/cmdline` check) - any of these alone would have
   meant no way back into the device after a first boot with no WiFi. **One real gap found and left
   open, arguably the most important one**: the real device's cmdline shows `root=/dev/mmcblk0p7` -
   U-Boot's own environment picks the root partition, not this build. Booting our image from the
   spare `p8` slot as planned requires U-Boot's environment to be told to use `p8` instead - real,
   unexplored bootloader-side work, not something Buildroot touches at all.
7. **[New since last session] Adapt GuppyScreen for this environment** - the three-option question
   in "GuppyScreen/OpenKE also needs adapting" above (point at pellcorp's `grumpyscreen`, port
   OpenKE's own UI, or a hybrid) is unresearched and will eventually need answering, but isn't
   blocking anything above yet - it's downstream of tracks 1 and 3 actually working.
8. **[Steps 1-7 DONE 2026-07-19, GuppyScreen deliberately deferred] App stack** - planned in
   `FIRMWARE.md` §13, **built in §14**. Python3 (+pip), Klipper (SimpleAF's fork - `klippy/` only,
   its `chelper` C extension cross-compiled fresh rather than trusting the fork's own checked-in
   prebuilt binary), Moonraker (official `Arksine/moonraker`, its one real C extension
   `streaming-form-data` also cross-compiled fresh), nginx (Buildroot's own package, not the main
   OpenKE project's externally-built binary - avoids a toolchain/glibc ABI mismatch), and
   **Mainsail** (real prebuilt release fetched, real canonical nginx reverse-proxy config sourced
   from `mainsail-crew/kiauh`, not invented) are all now real code, confirmed present in
   `rootfs.ext2` via `debugfs`. Camera verification (item 6) is closed too - Mainsail's webcam panel
   has a real, working proxy path to `ustreamer`. **Zero real-device writes** - three real
   build-environment bugs found and fixed along the way (ext2 image too small once Python landed;
   Buildroot's internal toolchain needed a forced C++ rebuild; a stale duplicate init script
   survived a rootfs-overlay file deletion until manually cleared from `output/target`) - full
   detail in `FIRMWARE.md` §14. GuppyScreen still gets only a later, minimal manual smoke test (not
   done) - the real "merge GuppyScreen's install/deploy assumptions into this environment" effort
   (item 7 above) stays separate. **None of steps 1-7 have executed on the real target CPU** - step
   8 (the actual boot test) is the next real milestone, still needs the user present.

**Recommended order now that items 2-4, 6, and 8 (steps 1-7) are done**: Track 3 item 1 first
(concrete, ready, low-risk, unblocks track 2 entirely as a byproduct - real device/insmod work, do
with the user present), **then Track 1 item 5** (real-hardware validation of `klippy_extras/` -
also needs the user present), **then item 8's step 8** (the real app-stack boot test - also needs
the user present, and is now the single most valuable next real-hardware session for Track 3, since
everything up to that point is built and waiting). Squashfs conversion and item 7's GuppyScreen
question can wait, both substantial enough to warrant their own dedicated session.

**U-Boot slot-selection gap RESOLVED 2026-07-19/20 via live read-only forensics on the real
device** (`FIRMWARE.md` §19): there is no U-Boot env at all on this device (no `fw_printenv`, no
MTD env store) - the entire A/B mechanism is one plaintext marker (`ota:kernel` / `ota:kernel2`)
in a dedicated 1MB `ota` partition (`/dev/mmcblk0p1`), read/written by Creality's own
`/etc/ota_bin/*.sh` via plain `dd`. Booting our image from the spare slot needs no U-Boot changes:
write `uImage`→`/dev/mmcblk0p6` (`kernel2`), `rootfs.squashfs`→`/dev/mmcblk0p8` (`rootfs2`), then
write the string `ota:kernel2` to `/dev/mmcblk0p1`. Reverting is the same trick in reverse
(`ota:kernel`, its current value). **Real regression risk found in the same pass**: `kernel2`/
`rootfs2` are NOT blank - both already hold Creality's real factory-fallback image (valid uImage/
squashfs magic, confirmed via read-only `dd`+`od`). Mitigated: both partitions were pulled
byte-for-byte to the workstation first (`kernel2.img`/`rootfs2.img`, md5-recorded, kept out of git
- proprietary firmware, not project code) before anything is ever written to them. The boot test
itself (writing our own image + flipping the marker) is still real, still needs the user present,
and should only happen with that backup confirmed in place first.

## Scope corrected 2026-07-18 - read this before anything else

**Correction, same day as the pause above**: the standing assumption that a full mainline-Klipper
migration needs an SWD reflash was wrong. [pellcorp's SimpleAF](https://github.com/pellcorp/creality)
already runs a custom, mainline-adjacent Klipper build on this exact printer (Ender 3 V3 KE is an
explicitly supported target) with **zero SWD, zero soldering** - via a reverse-engineered serial
in-application-programming protocol (`k1/mcu_util.py` in that repo) that flashes custom firmware
over the same serial line Klipper already uses. SimpleAF's own FAQ is explicit that dropping
load-cell probe support was a choice, not a limitation: *"There are no plans to support load cells
in simple af."* Full correction with sources: the OpenKE memory file
`project_mainline_klipper_ke_separate.md`'s "CORRECTED 2026-07-18" section (near the top).

**What this changes**: this workspace's actual job is best described as **"SimpleAF + the probe."**
Everything analyzed/designed here (protocol, algorithm, module skeleton) is still exactly right and
still needed - it's the one piece SimpleAF deliberately doesn't provide. What's newly open: whether
`klippy_extras/`'s design should target SimpleAF's own environment directly (their Klipper fork,
their config/mount conventions) rather than a hypothetical standalone host tree - not yet
researched, flagged as the next real question once work resumes.

Still paused until `ke-next` (the separate OpenKE/GuppyScreen repo) finishes its own real-device
testing.

## The end-user story (why this project exists, in plain terms)

Today, this printer is stuck on Creality's own frozen, unmaintained Klipper fork - any fix or
feature that lands in the real Klipper project doesn't reach this printer unless someone manually
re-ports it. SimpleAF is a real, working way off that dead end onto an actively-maintained,
mainline-adjacent Klipper build - but today, choosing it means giving up the built-in load-cell
auto-Z-tune entirely: either do a fully manual Z-offset check before every print, or buy and
physically install a separate aftermarket probe (Klicky, Cartographer, etc.).

**What this project delivers to an end user**: everything SimpleAF already gives you (a maintained
Klipper base instead of an abandoned vendor fork) *plus* the exact same day-to-day experience the
stock firmware already provides - the printer auto-probes and fine-tunes its own Z-offset before
each print, using the load cell already built into the machine, no new hardware, no lost
convenience. Today those two things (real Klipper vs. keep your auto-probe) are mutually exclusive
on this printer; closing that gap is the entire point.

## GuppyScreen/OpenKE also needs adapting - new, real scope item, not yet started

**Confirmed 2026-07-18: an end user on "SimpleAF + this probe module" would also need an adapted
GuppyScreen, not stock OpenKE as-is.** OpenKE's GuppyScreen (`~/Documents/guppyscreen`, `ke-next`)
talks to the Moonraker/Klipper API the same way regardless of which Klipper fork is underneath, but
it's currently built, tested, and released assuming Creality's stock software environment (their
init system, their file layout, their specific `printer.cfg` conventions, their bundled
Moonraker/nginx/etc - see the OpenKE memory's `project_moonraker_nginx_dependency.md` and
`project_ke_deploy.md` for how deep that assumption runs). SimpleAF's environment is genuinely
different (their own install layout, config conventions, service management).

**Open question, not yet researched or decided**: pellcorp (SimpleAF's author) already maintains
their own GuppyScreen fork, **"grumpyscreen"** (see the OpenKE memory's
`reference_pellcorp_grumpyscreen.md` - already a known sibling project, we've shared touchscreen
commits with them before). The real options for whoever picks this up:
1. Point end users at pellcorp's existing `grumpyscreen` for the UI layer, and only ship our own
   prtouch/z_compensate module as an add-on to their environment - least new work, but means the
   UI experience isn't OpenKE's own and any OpenKE-specific feature work doesn't reach these users.
2. Adapt OpenKE's own GuppyScreen to run on SimpleAF's environment directly - more work, keeps
   OpenKE's own UI/feature set, but is real, unscoped porting effort (how much of `ke-next`'s
   install/deploy assumptions break under SimpleAF's layout is completely unknown right now).
3. Some hybrid (upstream useful pieces between the two projects) - not explored at all.

None of this is decided or researched beyond noting it exists. Whoever resumes this project should
treat "which UI approach" as a real open design question, not something to assume an answer to.

## Current focus

The load-cell/pressure-probe ("prtouch") auxiliary Z-fine-tune layer - the one thing SimpleAF
doesn't provide. Building it doesn't require reflashing the toolhead MCU either way: the
currently-installed (Creality) firmware already implements the custom commands needed, and a new
host-side Klipper "extra" can talk to it directly, the same way Creality's own
`hx711s.py`/`dirzctl.py` do, using entirely standard Klipper host APIs (`mcu.create_oid()`,
`mcu.add_config_cmd()`, `mcu.lookup_command()`, `mcu.register_response()`).

Basic motion/homing/heating/BLTouch is a separate, already-solved problem either way - mainline's
own `bltouch.py` is stock, and SimpleAF already provides a complete working base for everything
except this probe layer, with no SWD required.

## Layout

- `scripts/build/` - **real, tested, runnable scripts that reproduce the entire Track 3 custom
  firmware/OS build from scratch** (`FIRMWARE.md` §8-15, §39) - fetching every pinned vendor source
  (including this project's own kernel fork, see below), configuring Buildroot, building the kernel +
  rootfs, cross-compiling the app-stack extras, and verifying the result, all Docker-only with zero
  real-device writes. See `scripts/build/README.md` for prerequisites and how to run them - this is
  the actual way to reproduce this project's build, not just a description of what was done.
- Every kernel-source change this project made (touch/display/WiFi/Bluetooth/the NS2009 port) lives
  as real, reviewable commits on the `openke` branch of
  [`coreflake1/NebulaOS-kernel`](https://github.com/coreflake1/NebulaOS-kernel) (renamed 2026-08-14
  from `coreflake1/NebulaOS`) - a real fork of the original
  upstream kernel SDK (`Llixuma/ingenic-linux-kernel6.6-x2000-v1.0-20250221`), not a patch file
  applied at build time (`FIRMWARE.md` §39). `main` on the fork tracks upstream unmodified.
- `reference/` - real source Creality published for this exact subsystem (a different printer
  line, K1, but confirmed byte-for-byte matching command signatures against our own KE's compiled
  binary via `strings`). GPLv3-licensed, copyright Creality. Fetched from
  [`CrealityOfficial/K1_Series_Klipper@e09f36e6`](https://github.com/CrealityOfficial/K1_Series_Klipper/commit/e09f36e6ada60e5467b0bef731a96263b5d8095b)
  ("open prtouch_v1 and prtouch_v2 source code"). A second copy lives in the OpenKE memory
  directory (`reference_prtouch_v2_source/`) for durability - treat these as identical, sha256
  recorded there.
  - `prtouch_v2_wrapper.py` - host-side Python, the currently-relevant generation (matches what's
    actually compiled into our KE's `prtouch_v2_wrapper.cpython-38-mipsel-linux-gnu.so`).
  - `prtouch_v2.c` - MCU firmware C source for the same commands - confirms these are implemented
    using stock Klipper firmware infra (`DECL_COMMAND`, `sched_add_timer`, `gpio_adc_sample`,
    `sendf`), not proprietary plumbing.
  - `prtouch_v1_wrapper.py` - older generation, fetched for completeness, not yet cross-checked
    against this device (which runs v2-era code).
- `klippy_extras/` - the new, OpenKE-authored replacement module. Six files
  (`prtouch_v2.py`/`prtouch_mcu.py`/`prtouch_calibration.py`/`prtouch_probe.py`/
  `prtouch_nozzle.py`/`z_compensate.py`) **implemented 2026-07-19** - real logic, not skeletons;
  `test_prtouch_calibration.py` has 17 passing standalone unit tests for the pure-math half. Not
  yet tested against real MCU firmware - see the Todo above. See `DESIGN.md` for the layout
  rationale and its "What actually changed during implementation" section for specifics.
- `ANALYSIS.md` - complete protocol + algorithm write-up, both reference source files read in full,
  real production scope confirmed against the live printer. The technical source of truth for
  track 1.
- `DESIGN.md` - the `klippy_extras/` module layout sketch, including the one real naming-
  compatibility decision and two smaller open questions, all flagged for confirmation before real
  implementation starts.
- `NETWORKING.md` - track 2's write-up (the USB-ethernet adapter investigation).
- `FIRMWARE.md` - track 3's write-up and the actual phased gameplan (research/acquisition ->
  ethernet-module proof -> custom Buildroot rootfs -> eventual real flash). The source of truth for
  "how hard would a full custom firmware/OS be" - kept current in place as work progresses.
- `vendor/` - **gitignored**, not committed. Real, exact-version-matching kernel source
  (`x2000_kernel`, 4.4.94) and a matching Halley5 Buildroot config (`buildroot-x2000`), both found
  via GitHub code search and cloned for track 3/Phase 1 work. Also `x2000_kernel_6.6` (sparse
  checkout of `Llixuma/ingenic-linux-kernel6.6-x2000-v1.0-20250221`'s `kernel/kernel-6.6`, ~1.8 GB)
  - the current Phase 2 kernel source, referenced by `buildroot-x2000/local.mk`'s
  `LINUX_OVERRIDE_SRCDIR`. Provenance/exact repo URLs and commit state are recorded in `FIRMWARE.md`
  §4a (4.4.94 tree) and §8 (6.6 tree) - re-clone from there if this workspace ever moves, don't
  assume `vendor/` travels with the repo.
- **`artifacts/ax88179-modules/` - MOVED 2026-07-19** to
  `~/Documents/guppyscreen/scripts/build-ax88179-mipsel.sh` +
  `~/Documents/guppyscreen/scripts/vendor/modules/` - this build targets the real device's
  *current, stock* 4.4.94 kernel (not this workspace's custom 6.6 rebuild, which needs its own
  separate build, see `FIRMWARE.md` §16), so it's properly homed with the actively-shipped OpenKE
  project instead of duplicated across both repos. `FIRMWARE.md` §5 step 4 still has the original
  build recipe/gotchas write-up for historical reference.
- `artifacts/buildroot-halley5-image/` - **superseded, kept for reference** - built kernel
  (`uImage`, Linux 6.1.28) + rootfs from track 3/Phase 2's *original* build against
  `Ingenic-community/linux`, before the rebase below. Not deleted since it's still a valid build of
  a different kernel lineage, just no longer the current target.
- `artifacts/buildroot-halley5-v30-image/` - **current** track 3/Phase 2 build: `uImage` (Linux
  **6.6.18-rt23**) + `rootfs.ext2` (Buildroot 2023.11.1) + `buildroot.config`/`kernel.config`
  (exact configs used) + `local.mk` (the source-override mechanism) + `binder-h-fix-note.txt`,
  built against `Llixuma/ingenic-linux-kernel6.6-x2000-v1.0-20250221` (rebased here 2026-07-19 by
  explicit user instruction - see `FIRMWARE.md` §8), **updated again the same day (2026-07-19,
  "build everything first" pass) to include touch/display/WiFi/BT** - now also has
  `halley5-nebulaos-fragment.config` (the Buildroot kernel-config fragment) alongside the existing
  configs. **Not gitignored on purpose**, same reasoning as the ax88179 artifacts above. See
  `FIRMWARE.md` §8 for the original build recipe/errors and §10 for this session's additions, what
  was verified (cross-compile + `debugfs` inspection) vs. not (no real hardware attempted), and
  what's still needed for production parity.
- `artifacts/panel-driver/` - the new best-effort 480x272 display panel driver
  (`panel-openke-general-480x272.c` + built `.ko`), written from scratch this session for the
  ingenicfb "fb_stage" framework. See the driver's own header comment for what's confirmed
  (GPIO pins, resolution/refresh) vs. best-effort (exact timing, polarity, color depth), and
  `FIRMWARE.md` §10 for the two real compile-error fixes along the way.
- `artifacts/ustreamer/` - cross-compiled `pellcorp/k1-ustreamer` binary + its shared library
  dependencies (real MIPS32r2 ELF, confirmed via `file`) - built this session for the camera
  pipeline, not yet integrated into the Buildroot rootfs image itself (real remaining work, see
  `FIRMWARE.md` §10's closing list).
