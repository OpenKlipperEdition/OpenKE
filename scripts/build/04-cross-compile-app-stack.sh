### 3. ustreamer (camera pipeline)
#
# OpenKE fix (USB/webcam stock-parity mission, FIRMWARE.md sec 60): this
# used to build via pellcorp's own `pellcorp/k1-camera-build` docker image,
# which bundles Ingenic's stock vendor toolchain
# (/opt/toolchains/mips-gcc720-glibc229, glibc 2.29). That toolchain's
# glibc uses a DIFFERENT MIPS ABI than this project's own Buildroot-built
# target glibc (2.38, confirmed via /lib/libc.so.6's own banner:
# "libc ABIs: MIPS_PLT UNIQUE MIPS_O32_FP64 ABSOLUTE MIPS_XHASH") - the
# resulting ustreamer.bin's own dynamic-linker request
# (`readelf -l` -> "Requesting program interpreter:
# /lib/ld-linux-mipsn8.so.1") never matched this rootfs's real interpreter
# (plain /lib/ld.so.1), so the binary could never actually execute here -
# busybox ash reports this as a confusing "not found" (it's really the
# missing interpreter, not the file itself; confirmed real files/libs were
# all present and correctly staged). This was never caught before because
# no prior session had a real UVC webcam physically attached to test with.
#
# Fix: build the *exact same*, untouched pellcorp/k1-ustreamer source
# (still vendor/k1-ustreamer at its pinned commit, submodules unchanged)
# with this project's own internal Buildroot toolchain instead - the same
# one already used for Klipper's chelper and Moonraker's streaming-form-
# data above, guaranteeing ABI consistency with the rest of the rootfs.
# Mirrors docker.sh's own real, proven build steps (jpeg-9d, libevent,

### 7. NebulaOS mutable-runtime mission, Phase 4 (revised - real-history
# repair mission, see docs/NEBULAOS_MOONRAKER_UPDATE_AND_CAMERA_ANALYSIS.md
# and the auto-updates-camera-complete mission): immutable offline factory
# seeds for Klipper and Moonraker, baked into the read-only squashfs so
# first-boot namespace seeding (S04nebulaos-factory-seed) never depends on
# GitHub, PyPI, or DNS being reachable. Mainsail needs no seed archive - it
# is already a plain static release tree, not a git repo, so the existing
# /usr/share/mainsail copy above IS its own offline seed; first-boot
# seeding just cp -a's it.
#
# PRIOR APPROACH (removed): each vendor checkout was flattened into a
# single synthetic orphan commit ("NebulaOS factory seed snapshot of
# <branch> @ <true_commit>") before bundling, because a plain
# `git bundle create` of vendor/klipper's depth-1 shallow clone
# (00-fetch-vendor-sources.sh's clone_branch) produces a bundle that
# `git bundle verify` reports as fine but a real `git clone` of rejects
# with "Failed to traverse parents of commit ..." / "remote did not send all
# necessary objects" (confirmed again against git 2.55.0 - a genuine,
# still-present git limitation, not a syntax mistake). That synthetic
# commit had no shared ancestry with the real Klipper3d/klipper
# or Arksine/moonraker history on GitHub, which made Moonraker's own
# `git merge-base --is-ancestor HEAD origin/<branch>` check permanently
# fail (return code 1) on every freshly-seeded device - HEAD could never
# be an ancestor of a real remote branch it shared no history with. This
# set `diverged=true` -> `has_recoverable_errors()=true` ->
# `is_valid()=false` (vendor/moonraker/moonraker/components/update_manager/
# git_deploy.py) permanently, blocking every real Klipper/Moonraker update.
#
# FIX: stop bundling/flattening entirely. Archive each vendor checkout's
# REAL `.git` directory (shallow boundary, real branch, real commits) plus
# its working tree as a plain tar file, with the local branch renamed to
# match Moonraker's hardcoded reserved-slot expectation ("master" - see
# BASE_CONFIG in update_manager/common.py, not configurable) and origin
# rewritten to the real public remote. On-device seeding (S04) then
# extracts the tar directly into place - no `git clone` at all, which is
# also strictly cheaper on this 208MB device than the clone-from-bundle
# step it replaces (plain tar extraction does no object repacking).
# vendor/klipper follows the official master branch configured in
# manifests/dependencies.conf. The archive preserves that real upstream
# history so Moonraker can fetch and update it normally after first boot.
# vendor/moonraker is already a full (non-shallow) clone of the official
# Arksine/moonraker repo with HEAD == origin/master, so it needs no branch
# surgery at all - only the same archive-instead-of-bundle treatment.
# make_seed_archive() itself lives in scripts/build/lib/make-seed-archive.sh,
# shared verbatim with tests/factory-seed-git-tests.sh so the tests exercise
# this exact function rather than a parallel reimplementation of its rules.

# Production optimization mission, Phase 11 (2026-07-30): pre-built venv
# seeds, so S04nebulaos-factory-seed can extract a ready-made virtualenv
# on first boot instead of running `python3 -m venv` live on this
# underpowered target (confirmed live: ~59s per venv, ~118s combined,
# the single largest first-boot cost this project has ever measured).
#
# Root cause found live: neither setup_klipper_env() nor
# setup_moonraker_env() passes --without-pip, so every venv creation also
# runs ensurepip - confirmed by inspecting a real, already-created venv on
# the device: lib/python3.11/site-packages/ contains ONLY pip, setuptools,
# and pkg_resources (nothing else - --system-site-packages correctly makes
# every real dependency invisible from that directory, inherited instead
# via the site-packages .pth mechanism), and that alone accounts for the
# entire venv's 25.5MB footprint. ensurepip's own wheel-unpack-and-install
# work is almost certainly the dominant cost of the ~59s, not the venv
# module's own (otherwise tiny) scaffolding.
#
# A venv's own files are not architecture-specific - pyvenv.cfg is plain

# any later boot stage could try to read /opt/printer_data/config as "the

# populated printer.cfg/moonraker.conf into a fresh persistent copy was a
# migration from a legacy /usr/data/openke path, deleted as part of an
# earlier closure mission on the belief no fresh device would ever need it

# Reproduced live: a truly wiped /usr/data/nebulaos/printer_data/config
# left Klipper and Moonraker crash-looping forever on FileNotFoundError.
