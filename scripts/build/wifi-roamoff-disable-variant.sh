# Applies the brcmfmac roamoff-default patch (NebulaOS WiFi/camera IRQ
# contention mission, 2026-08-03 - see
# scripts/build/patches/wifi-roamoff-disable.patch) to the vendor kernel
# checkout.
#
# THIS IS THE ONLY SCRIPT ALLOWED TO TOUCH
#   kernel/kernel-6.6/drivers/net/wireless/broadcom/brcm80211/brcmfmac/common.c
# FROM NOW ON - same overlapping-variant-script discipline as the other
# *-variant.sh scripts.
#
# Background: this printer is physically stationary and never needs to
# roam between APs. brcmfmac's own firmware roaming engine (background
# off-channel scanning to evaluate candidate APs - a firmware-level
# behavior, entirely independent of wpa_supplicant, which has no bgscan
# directive configured here at all) was live-identified as one real,
# machine-side contributor to a small steady rate of WiFi tx failures
# during sustained webcam streaming - on top of the separately-fixed
# USB<->WiFi IRQ priority contention (see
# pinctrl-ownership-fix-variant.sh's sibling mission work the same day -
# no, wrong file, see the S9x IRQ priority init.d script instead).
# brcmfmac is compiled into this kernel (no loadable .ko - lsmod is
# empty), so this could not be live-tested via module reload the way a
# real loadable module's parameters could; it takes effect only via a
# genuine kernel rebuild. Verified from source (cfg80211.c) that roamoff
# only gates WIPHY_FLAG_SUPPORTS_FW_ROAM (the firmware roaming engine
# specifically) - normal connection/association scanning is unaffected.
#
# ROAMOFF0 (default/pristine): baseline brcmfmac, roaming engine enabled
#     (brcmf_roamoff = 0, unchanged from upstream).
# ROAMOFF1: applies scripts/build/patches/wifi-roamoff-disable.patch
#     (brcmf_roamoff = 1 - firmware roaming engine disabled).
#
# Same "always reset to the real git-committed baseline first" pattern as
# the sibling variant scripts.
#
# IMPORTANT: never run this script while any build against this same
# vendor kernel checkout is in flight.
#
# Usage: sh scripts/build/wifi-roamoff-disable-variant.sh <ROAMOFF0|ROAMOFF1>
