# *** DEPRECATED (2026-08-01+) - DO NOT RUN AGAINST A CURRENT CHECKOUT ***
# Superseded by scripts/build/touch-qualification-variant.sh
# (CONFIG_TOUCHSCREEN_NS2009_QUALIFICATION), which subsumes this variant's
# read-only poll-diagnostic counters as its runtime "poll-only" mode's
# additive counters, plus TOUCH-I0-DIAG's IRQ observation and a new
# irq-assist mode, all behind ONE Kconfig symbol.
#
# Kept only for project-history/test reference - DO NOT run this script
# against the vendor kernel checkout, and NEVER compose it with
# touch-qualification-variant.sh, touch-i0-diag-variant.sh, or
# touch-irq-variant.sh in the same build. All four scripts do a full
# `git checkout --` of the exact same two files
# (kernel/kernel-6.6/drivers/input/touchscreen/{Kconfig,ns2009.c}) as their
# own "off" step - applying one and then reverting a DIFFERENT one silently
# discards the first one's patch too, including its Kconfig option's own
# definition, with ZERO error anywhere in the build (this is the precise
# failure mode touch-qualification-variant.sh exists to retire - see its
# own header comment for the full incident history).
#
# Original header follows, describing this now-superseded variant:
#
# Applies the TOUCH-D0-DIAG compile-only read-only touch GPIO
# characterization diagnostic (display/touch investigation mission
# follow-on, 2026-08-01+ - see
# build-work/display-analysis/touch-path-analysis.txt and
# scripts/build/patches/touch-poll-diag-gate.patch) to the vendor kernel
# checkout, for a compile test only.
#
#   D0 (default/today): baseline ns2009.c, no diagnostic counters.
#   D1 (prototype): applies scripts/build/patches/touch-poll-diag-gate.patch
#       (Kconfig option + struct fields + read-only diagnostic hooks, all
#       guarded by #ifdef CONFIG_TOUCHSCREEN_NS2009_POLL_DIAG so the
#       compiled code is byte-for-byte identical to D0 unless the option
#       is also selected in the Kconfig fragment - which THIS script does
#       as its second step), and selects
#       CONFIG_TOUCHSCREEN_NS2009_POLL_DIAG=y in the tracked Kconfig
#       fragment.
#
#       D1 characterizes the existing pendown-gpios 30ms polling path
#       with ZERO behavior change - it does not alter the poll interval,
#       coordinate reads, calibration, filtering, or input event
#       reporting in any way. It only adds in-memory-only diagnostic
#       counters (debugfs), updated at the exact same call sites the
#       existing code already has (the poll tick, the touch-down
#       transition, the release transition) - never logged per-poll to
#       the kernel log, never influencing any existing decision.
#
# Same "always reset to the real git-committed baseline first" pattern as
# the sibling variant scripts (display-vsync-variant.sh/
# touch-irq-variant.sh). This script and touch-irq-variant.sh/
# touch-i0-diag-variant.sh all touch the same two files
# (Kconfig/ns2009.c) via a full git-checkout-first reset - they are
# mutually exclusive, one-at-a-time variants, not meant to be combined;
# whichever script runs last wins, same tradeoff those sibling scripts
# already make.
#
# IMPORTANT: never run this script while any build against this same
# vendor kernel checkout is in flight - see the equivalent warning in
# touch-irq-variant.sh.
#
# Usage: sh scripts/build/touch-d0-diag-variant.sh <D0|D1>
