# NebulaOS mainline print-controls mission (2026-07-29, see
# docs/NEBULAOS_FRONTEND_PRINT_CONTROLS.md). Shared by
# scripts/build/04-cross-compile-app-stack.sh (real build, validates the
# tracked overlay source) and tests/nebulaos-frontend-controls-validation-
# tests.sh (offline fixture configs) - kept in its own file specifically
# so the tests exercise this exact function, not a second/parallel
# reimplementation of its validation rules (same convention as
# scripts/build/lib/make-seed-archive.sh).
#
# Every function here prints its own OK/FATAL lines and returns 0/1 - none
# of them call exit, so callers (a real build script, or a test harness
# that wants to keep going after a failure) decide what a failure means.
#
# Resolves every [include ...] starting from a given config file, relative
# to a config source directory, into a single flat file - this project's
# configs only ever use plain literal filenames in includes (one level of
# GuppyScreen/ nesting), never glob patterns, so this is a deliberately
# simple closure builder, not a general Klipper config parser.
#
# Usage: frontend_controls_resolve_closure <config_src_dir> <entry_file> <closure_out_file>

	# own rc_dirname (e.g. "." while resolving printer.cfg's own top-level
	# includes) once the recursive call returned - invisible for years
	# because printer.cfg only ever had ONE nested-dir include, always last,
	# so there was never a "next top-level include" for the clobbered value
	# to corrupt. Adding a second nested-dir include after
	# GuppyScreen/guppy_cmd.cfg exposed it immediately: every subsequent
	# top-level include got silently misresolved as GuppyScreen/<name>.
