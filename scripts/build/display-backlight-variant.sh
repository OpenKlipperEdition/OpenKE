# Applies the DISPLAY-B1 compile-only backlight-class prototype (display
# hardware analysis mission, 2026-08-01 - see
# docs/NEBULAOS_DISPLAY_OS_HARDWARE_ANALYSIS.md and
# build-work/display-analysis/backlight-path-analysis.txt) to the vendor
# kernel's tracked DTS, for a compile test only. NEVER apply this to a build
# destined for the active/production slot - see the live qualification plan
# (docs/NEBULAOS_DISPLAY_LIVE_QUALIFICATION_PLAN.md, test HT-01/HT-09) for
# why the real electrical behavior of GPC-0/GPC-22 must be confirmed on a
# spare slot first.
#
#   S0 (default/today): no backlight DT node exists at all. CONFIG_BACKLIGHT_
#       CLASS_DEVICE/PWM/GPIO are already =y (unrelated to this script,
#       already true in the base defconfig) but nothing in the compiled DTS
#       consumes them - PROVEN_FROM_SOURCE, see backlight-path-analysis.txt.
#   S1 (prototype): adds a real "pwm-backlight" DT node, and repoints the
#       existing &pwm override from the currently-unused GPC-1/channel1 pin
#       (pinctrl-0 = <&pwm1_pc>, zero consumers anywhere) to GPC-0/channel0
#       (pwm0_pc) - the pin stock's own live GPIO dump labels
#       "backlight_pwm0" and stock's own pwm_backlight.sh script drives at
#       50kHz. GPC-0 is confirmed free on this board: the only other claim
#       on it (the first &msc2 override's ingenic,sdr-gpio property) is
#       itself overridden to status="disabled" later in the same file (see
#       the file's own OpenKE 2026-07-23 comment on this exact conflict).
#       This DOES NOT wire a power-enable GPIO (PC22, stock's separate
#       enable line) - that pin's real function is still UNKNOWN_UNTIL_
#       HARDWARE per backlight-path-analysis.txt, so S1 intentionally only
#       adds the PWM brightness path, not an assumed enable-line.
#
# Follow-up correction (powered-on investigation mission, 2026-08-01): the
# original version of this script used a sed marker-strip-then-append
# approach and had two real bugs - unescaped "/* */" BRE metacharacters
# breaking idempotency, and a residual trailing blank line left behind after
# reverting to S0 (invisible to this script's own git-clean check, because
# that check ran `git status` in the OUTER repo, which ignores the whole
# vendor/ tree entirely via .gitignore - a second real bug, since it made
# the "clean revert" test vacuously pass regardless of actual file content).
# Rewritten to match the established, more robust pattern already proven in
# the sibling scripts/build/wifi-sdio-variant.sh: always reset to the real
# git-committed baseline first (`git checkout` inside the vendor tree, not a
# sed-based revert), then apply the requested variant fresh. This eliminates
# the whole class of escaping/residue bugs, since every invocation starts
# from a known-clean state instead of trying to undo a previous edit.
#
