# Applies the DISPLAY-B0-DIAG compile-only bounded backlight probe
# diagnostic (display hardware analysis mission follow-on, 2026-08-01+ -
# see docs/NEBULAOS_DISPLAY_OS_HARDWARE_ANALYSIS.md,
# build-work/display-analysis/backlight-path-analysis.txt, and
# scripts/build/patches/display-backlight-probe-diag.patch) to the vendor
# kernel checkout, for a compile test only. NEVER apply this to a build
# destined for the active/production slot.
#
#   DIAG0 (default/today): no probe diagnostic driver, no DT node for it.
#       Identical to today's real baseline.
#   DIAG1 (prototype): applies scripts/build/patches/display-backlight-
#       probe-diag.patch (a new platform driver,
#       module_drivers/drivers/misc/nebulaos_backlight_probe_diag.c, plus
#       its Kconfig/Makefile wiring - all guarded by
#       #ifdef/depends-on CONFIG_NEBULAOS_BACKLIGHT_PROBE_DIAG so the
#       compiled tree is unaffected unless the option is also selected in
#       the Kconfig fragment, which THIS script does as a separate step),
#       selects CONFIG_NEBULAOS_BACKLIGHT_PROBE_DIAG=y in the tracked
#       Kconfig fragment, and adds a new DT node instantiating the
#       diagnostic driver against the two candidate hardware resources
#       (PWM channel 0 / pwm0_pc, and enable-gpios on candidate PC22) -
#       neither is proven correct, both are documented hypotheses only,
#       see backlight-path-analysis.txt.
#
#       This DTS edit repoints the existing &pwm node's pinctrl-0 from
#       the unused channel-1 pin to the real candidate channel-0 pin,
#       exactly like scripts/build/display-backlight-variant.sh's own S1
#       - the two scripts touch the same &pwm block in the same shared
#       DTS file and are NOT meant to be combined. Whichever variant
#       script runs last wins (each does a full `git checkout --` of the
#       DTS before editing) - this is the same tradeoff
#       display-backlight-variant.sh/wifi-sdio-variant.sh already make.
#
#       The diagnostic driver itself never touches PWM/GPIO state at
#       module bind time - it only records whatever state it can read at
#       that point (see the hardening-pass caveat below). Every probe is
#       opt-in via a bounded debugfs command interface (default 2s/max
#       3s timeout, longer rejected), arms the kernel-owned restore
#       watchdog BEFORE applying the one candidate hardware state, and
#       auto-restores via that workqueue timer regardless of whether an
#       explicit "restore" command ever arrives or the calling process
#       is still alive. See the driver's own file header comment for the
#       full safety-property list.
#
#       Hardening-pass honesty note (do not weaken/remove this): the
#       candidate enable-GPIO's recorded state IS a genuine hardware
#       readback (this board's gpio_chip .get callback reads the live
#       PxPIN register every time) and its restore is exact. The
#       candidate PWM channel's recorded "state" is NOT a hardware
#       readback - this board's bound PWM driver (pwm-ingenic-v2.c)
#       implements no .get_state callback, so the kernel's cached
#       pwm_device state for a channel nothing has ever requested before
#       is a synthetic disabled/zero value, not whatever the bootloader
#       actually left running. Its "restore" is a deliberate, documented
#       SAFE DEFAULT (disable the PWM), never claimed as an exact
#       reconstruction. See nebulaos_backlight_probe_diag.c's
#       "RESTORATION EXACTNESS" section and its debugfs
#       .../status pwm_restore_is_exact / gpio_restore_is_exact fields.
#
# Same "always reset to the real git-committed baseline first" pattern as
# the sibling variant scripts (display-vsync-variant.sh/
# touch-irq-variant.sh) - `git checkout --` on every affected file before
# deciding what DIAG0/DIAG1 needs, so repeated switches never drift or
# accumulate partial edits.
#
# IMPORTANT: never run this script while any build against this same
# vendor kernel checkout is in flight - a build's own source-tree
# fingerprint check (05-final-build.sh) will correctly refuse to trust
# artifacts built from a tree that changed mid-build. Apply the desired
# variant BEFORE starting a build, not during one.
