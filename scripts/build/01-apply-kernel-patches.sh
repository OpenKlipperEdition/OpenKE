# FIRMWARE.md sec 39: these changes used to be applied here at build time from
# patches/x2000_kernel_6.6-openke.patch. They're now carried by the requested
# Open Klipper Edition System `OKE` branch, and 00-fetch-vendor-sources.sh
# checks out its pinned commit directly,
# so there's nothing left to apply here. This script stays as stage "01" (kept
# numbered/in-sequence on purpose, so existing docs/muscle-memory still work)
# purely as a sanity check that the fork's content actually landed correctly.

# The old validation used to require `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`
# == "openke" here - it broke when the build began checking out an exact
# pinned commit during the Phase 9-vs-Phase-11 rebuild-and-compare test:
# 00-fetch-vendor-sources.sh checks out $KERNEL_PIN directly instead of
# leaving the checkout on the moving $KERNEL_BRANCH:
# checking out an exact commit SHA is normal, correct, DETACHED HEAD in
# git - `--abbrev-ref HEAD` reports the literal string "HEAD" there, not a
# branch name, so this check started failing a checkout that was actually
# exactly correct. Removed rather than special-cased: the pin check two
# lines below already independently verifies the real invariant that
# matters (are we at the exact accepted commit), with its own hardcoded
# constant, regardless of which branch (if any) that commit happens to be
# reachable from - being "on" a named branch was never actually load-
# bearing for anything this script does after this point.
#
# Defense in depth (2026-07-31, NEBULAOS_CAMERA_USB_RT_SOURCE_ANALYSIS.md's
# vendor-pin audit): 00-fetch-vendor-sources.sh already enforces this exact
# pin and fails loudly on drift, but this script shouldn't silently trust
# that it ran first/correctly - keep the same pin constant here and verify
# independently, so a hand-run `git pull` inside this checkout between the
# two scripts still gets caught.
