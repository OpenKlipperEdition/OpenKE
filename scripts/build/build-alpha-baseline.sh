# Alpha baseline freeze mission (2026-08-01): deterministic, documented
# build command for the NEBULAOS-ALPHA-MAX-RT composition (W3 SDIO +
# R1 PREEMPT_RT + HZ=100 unchanged + CN country unchanged), which the
# user has designated the new alpha integration baseline. See
# docs/NEBULAOS_ALPHA_BASELINE.md for the full composition record and
# docs/NEBULAOS_ALPHA_MAX_RT_DEPLOYMENT_REPORT.md for the live
# deployment this was first validated against.
#
# Deliberately the smallest mechanism that fits this repo's existing
# conventions - it just sequences the two existing variant scripts
# immediately before the real build pipeline (no intervening steps, per
# the real defect this mission fixed in
# tests/variant-state-preservation-tests.sh: running those test suites
# between "apply the variant" and "build" used to silently discard the
# selection), then runs the new artifact-composition assertions
# straight after the build finishes. Not a generic profile framework -
# P1 (Wi-Fi power-save-off) and C2 (camera idle-pause) are NOT part of
# this script, because they are runtime markers on /usr/data (see
# scripts/build/overlay/etc/nebulaos-wifi-power-save.sh and
# nebulaos-camera-idle-controller.sh), not build-time selections; they
# get activated after the image boots, exactly as they were for the
# real Alpha-Max-RT deployment.
#
# Usage: sh scripts/build/build-alpha-baseline.sh
#
# Exits non-zero if the variant application, any build stage, or the
# final composition assertion fails.
