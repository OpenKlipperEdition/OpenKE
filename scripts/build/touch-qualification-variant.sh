# Applies the TOUCH-QUALIFICATION unified poll/IRQ-observe/IRQ-assist
# runtime-selectable diagnostic (display/touch investigation mission
# unification, 2026-08-01+ - see
# scripts/build/patches/touch-qualification-unified.patch) to the vendor
# kernel checkout, for a compile test only.
#
# THIS IS THE ONLY SCRIPT ALLOWED TO TOUCH
#   kernel/kernel-6.6/drivers/input/touchscreen/Kconfig
#   kernel/kernel-6.6/drivers/input/touchscreen/ns2009.c
# FROM NOW ON.
#
# Background: three earlier, separate scripts (touch-d0-diag-variant.sh,
# touch-i0-diag-variant.sh, and the older touch-irq-variant.sh) all did a
# full `git checkout --` of these same two files as their own "off" step,
# then applied their own single patch. Because all three targeted the
# identical two files, applying one and then reverting a *different* one
# silently discarded the first one's patch too - including its Kconfig
# option's own definition - with ZERO error anywhere in the build
# (Buildroot's Kconfig fragment merge silently drops now-unknown symbols
# rather than failing). This already caused one real, silent,
# feature-missing package earlier in this project.
#
# TOUCH-QUALIFICATION retires that entire failure mode: it subsumes both
# TOUCH-D0-DIAG's read-only poll counters and TOUCH-I0-DIAG's IRQ
# observation in ONE Kconfig symbol
# (CONFIG_TOUCHSCREEN_NS2009_QUALIFICATION) and ONE unified driver, plus a
# new runtime-selectable irq-assist mode, so there is only ever one patch,
# one toggle script, and one set of tests governing these two files from
# here on. touch-d0-diag-variant.sh, touch-i0-diag-variant.sh, and
# touch-irq-variant.sh are now DEPRECATED (see the header comment added to
# each) - do not run any of them against this checkout, and never compose
# any of them with this script.
#
#   QUAL0 (default/today): baseline ns2009.c, no qualification feature.
#   QUAL1 (prototype): applies
#       scripts/build/patches/touch-qualification-unified.patch (Kconfig
#       option + struct fields + a runtime mode switch exposed via
#       debugfs, all guarded by #ifdef
#       CONFIG_TOUCHSCREEN_NS2009_QUALIFICATION so the compiled code is
#       byte-for-byte identical to QUAL0 unless the option is also
#       selected in the Kconfig fragment - which THIS script does as its
#       second step), and selects
#       CONFIG_TOUCHSCREEN_NS2009_QUALIFICATION=y in the tracked Kconfig
#       fragment.
#
#       The feature always boots into poll-only mode (byte-for-byte
#       identical to the original, unmodified 30ms poll path - no GPIO IRQ
#       requested). Two further runtime modes are selectable via
#       /sys/kernel/debug/ns2009_qualification/mode ("irq-observe",
#       "irq-assist") - see the patch/Kconfig help text for the full
#       design and fail-safe behavior of each.
#
# IMPORTANT: never run this script while any build against this same
# vendor kernel checkout is in flight - see the equivalent warning in the
# other touch-*-variant.sh scripts.
#
# Usage: sh scripts/build/touch-qualification-variant.sh <QUAL0|QUAL1>
