# *** DEPRECATED (2026-08-01+) - DO NOT RUN AGAINST A CURRENT CHECKOUT ***
# Superseded by scripts/build/touch-qualification-variant.sh
# (CONFIG_TOUCHSCREEN_NS2009_QUALIFICATION). This script's I1 variant used
# a both-edges trigger placeholder from before GPIO79's real edge/polarity
# was known from live evidence - that placeholder is now known-outdated
# (see docs/NEBULAOS_TOUCH_IRQ_TRIGGER_FINDINGS.md: GPIO79 is
# IDLE_HIGH_ACTIVE_LOW, touch-down is a FALLING edge) and must not be
# reused. touch-qualification-variant.sh's "irq-assist" mode is this
# script's real successor: falling-edge IRQ plus a 250ms safety-poll
# fallback, reusing the existing poll/report path for all I2C/coordinate
# work instead of calling it directly from IRQ context.
#
# Kept only for project-history/test reference (e.g. as a citation for the
# storm-protection pattern) - DO NOT run this script against the vendor
# kernel checkout, and NEVER compose it with touch-qualification-variant.sh,
# touch-d0-diag-variant.sh, or touch-i0-diag-variant.sh in the same build.
# All four scripts do a full `git checkout --` of the exact same two files
# (kernel/kernel-6.6/drivers/input/touchscreen/{Kconfig,ns2009.c}) as their
# own "off" step - applying one and then reverting a DIFFERENT one silently
# discards the first one's patch too, including its Kconfig option's own
# definition, with ZERO error anywhere in the build (this is the precise
# failure mode touch-qualification-variant.sh exists to retire - see its
# own header comment for the full incident history).
#
# Original header follows, describing this now-superseded variant:
#
# Applies the TOUCH-I1 compile-only IRQ-assisted touch-down prototype
# (powered-on display/touch investigation mission, 2026-08-01 - see
# docs/NEBULAOS_DISPLAY_OS_HARDWARE_ANALYSIS.md and
# build-work/display-analysis/touch-path-analysis.txt for the baseline this
# builds on: NS2009 pen-down detection is purely 30ms-polled today, despite
# stock's own separate closed driver proving GPIO79/GPIOC15 can generate a
# real interrupt).
#
#   I0 (default/today): baseline ns2009.c, pure 30ms polling only.
#   I1 (prototype): applies scripts/build/patches/touch-irq-gate.patch to
#       the vendor kernel checkout (Kconfig option + struct fields + a
#       threaded IRQ handler + a best-effort probe-time IRQ request, all
#       guarded by #ifdef CONFIG_TOUCHSCREEN_NS2009_PENDOWN_IRQ so the
#       compiled code is byte-for-byte identical to I0 unless the option is
#       also selected in the Kconfig fragment - which THIS script does as
#       its second step), and selects
#       CONFIG_TOUCHSCREEN_NS2009_PENDOWN_IRQ=y in the tracked Kconfig
#       fragment.
#
#       The existing 30ms poll remains ALWAYS ACTIVE and unmodified under
#       I1 - the IRQ is purely an additive latency accelerant (requests
#       BOTH edges on pendown-gpios, since the true active-high/low and
#       edge-direction semantics were never established from source alone;
#       any transition just triggers an immediate out-of-band touch report
#       via the same ns2009_ts_report() the poll already calls - actual
#       down/up state still comes from a fresh GPIO level read inside that
#       function, never from which edge fired). Includes storm protection
#       (permanently disables the IRQ and falls back to poll-only if the
#       pin toggles abnormally often) and a graceful no-op if the IRQ can't
#       be requested at all. Input availability never depends on this path
#       succeeding.
#
# Same "always reset to the real git-committed baseline first" pattern as
# the sibling variant scripts.
#
# IMPORTANT: never run this script while any build against this same vendor
# kernel checkout is in flight - see the equivalent warning in
# display-vsync-variant.sh (this project hit this exact mistake twice while
# preparing these prototypes; both mid-build edits triggered
# 05-final-build.sh's own source-tree fingerprint abort, correctly refusing
# to trust the resulting artifacts).
#
