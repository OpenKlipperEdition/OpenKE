# Offline, repeatable tests for scripts/build/preempt-variant.sh (pre-
# qualification mission Phase A8, 2026-07-31). Operates against the real
# tracked Kconfig fragment (artifacts/buildroot-halley5-v30-image/
# halley5-openke-fragment.config) - it's a small, git-tracked text file
# in the main repo, not a gitignored vendor checkout.
#
# Alpha baseline freeze mission (2026-08-01): real build-integrity defect
# found live - this suite's cleanup used to unconditionally `git checkout
# --` the fragment on exit, which restores whatever is COMMITTED (always
# R0, since R1 is never committed), not whatever was actually selected
# before this suite ran. Running this suite after deliberately applying
# R1 (as part of building a combined W3+R1 alpha image) silently discarded
# that R1 selection back to R0 before the build ever started - the build
# then produced a plain non-RT image despite R1 having been correctly
# applied moments earlier. Caught only by inspecting the built artifact's
# own kernel config, not by this suite's own exit status (a clean pass
# throughout). Fixed: snapshot the fragment's exact real pre-test bytes
# before any mutation, restore exactly those bytes on exit (success,
# failure, or signal) - never assume R0/git-HEAD was the starting state.
#
# Usage: sh tests/preempt-variant-tests.sh
