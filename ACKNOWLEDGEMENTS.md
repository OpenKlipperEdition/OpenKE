# Acknowledgements

NebulaOS doesn't exist in a vacuum. It's built on top of a lot of other people's work — some of it
vendored directly, some of it just a reference we leaned on to get something right. This page tries
to give credit where it's actually due, based on what's really in the repo and its history, not a
generic thank-you list.

## Pellcorp

A meaningful amount of the groundwork for this project's build and firmware work traces back to
[Pellcorp's](https://github.com/pellcorp) Creality K1/K1-family tooling. Specifically:

- **[`pellcorp/klipper`](https://github.com/pellcorp/klipper)** — used as a reference to verify the
  sign convention in our own probe/Z-compensation code while building `z_compensate.py`.
- **[`pellcorp/k1-ustreamer`](https://github.com/pellcorp/k1-ustreamer)** — NebulaOS's camera
  pipeline is a real port of this project (`K1_USTREAMER_REPO`/`K1_USTREAMER_PIN`).
- **`pellcorp/k1-bash-build`** — for a long time, this was the actual MIPS cross-compile toolchain
  container this project's earlier build ran inside. As of the unified build environment
  work (2026-08-15), both now use NebulaOS's own build image instead — but that image bundles the
  same toolchain this container provided, and its build recipe was faithfully reconstructed from the
  original image rather than replaced with something different. We're not still using the container,
  but the groundwork it represents is still part of how this builds.
- **[`pellcorp/k1-nginx`](https://github.com/pellcorp/k1-nginx)** — this project's build recipe
  uses its K1 nginx cross-compile work as a reference.

If you're coming from the Pellcorp/K1 side of the Creality modding world, a good chunk of what made
this project possible started there.

## HelixScreen

NebulaOS's K1 touchscreen UI is built from:

- [`prestonbrown/helixscreen`](https://github.com/prestonbrown/helixscreen) — the pinned HelixScreen K1 source

## Recovery tooling

The USB recovery path documented in `docs/DEVELOPER_RECOVERY.md` and
`docs/HOW_TO_SWITCH_STOCK_AND_CUSTOM.md` only exists because of
[`ballaswag/ingenic-usbboot`](https://github.com/ballaswag/ingenic-usbboot) — genuinely couldn't
do that recovery path without it.

## The rest of the stack

- [Klipper](https://github.com/Klipper3d/klipper) and [Moonraker](https://github.com/Arksine/moonraker) — the printer firmware and API server this whole thing runs on
- [Mainsail](https://github.com/mainsail-crew/mainsail) — the web UI
- [Buildroot](https://buildroot.org/) — the base of our whole build system
- The Linux kernel, and the Ingenic X2000 SDK/BSP this board's kernel support is built from
- Creality, for the original K1/KE hardware and SDK source this project builds on top of
